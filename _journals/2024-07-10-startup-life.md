<p>I'm super pumped to say that I'm joining an early-stage startup soon <img class="twemoji" style="vertical-align: text-top;" src="../assets/img/emoji/fire.svg" alt=""> The co-working space is buzzing, downtown vibes are incredible, and the drive to make an impact is real!</p>

<p>I'll be keeping this post open-ended to share interesting experiences, and lessons learned along the wayâ€”be it challenges, triumphs, or even the unexpected moments.</p>
