## Memes and the Intellectual Property Issue

In recent years, access to content over the internet has been a lot easier and ever-growing. Most content creators out there are reasonable and ask for one thing, **ATTRIBUTION**.

Especially with the use of memes, often the images used for memes are tied with intellectual property issues. Furthermore, the original creator of the meme can have copyrights too.

## Companies and Copyright

While companies and individuals are not exactly tracking every user on the internet to send notices and takedown copied content, it's more of a moral obligation to respect each other's time for content creation, which is one of the reasons you don't see big firms posting memes. As much as they want to connect with the consumers, copying content does not justify it.

In the past years, I have been fairly mindful of the use of images and ensured to include references and attributions to the extent that I took down close to 40 blog posts that reused featured images and lacked references.

## Commercial purposes and the copyright conundrum

In most cases, if you are sharing memes for fun on social media, it's not much of a problem. However, if you are using it for commercial purposes, for example, through the company's marketing channels, this will attract the attention of copyright owners of the original content. All it takes is an unhappy content owner to claim for damages [1].

## Geeks for Geeks

So I decided to validate how brands in the development community ensure copyrights and references on their website and social media.
For demonstration, let's take [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/).

Glancing over a bunch of articles and posts, it's clear that the standard for references are poor. No footnotes, research paper references do not follow any citing standards, and in some cases, no reference(s) to start with (the list goes on).

However, the recent posts seem a lot better when it comes to rephrasing and reference(s) but lack citing standards.

Coming to Social Media (LinkedIn), take a look at this post on [Women's Day](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geeksforgeeks_saluting-the-real-superheroes-activity-6906925551639232512-9Ajf)

If not all, most images are from [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/), to emphasize the very first image ([Source Image from Freepick](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/feminist-composition-with-grunge-fist_3281844.htm)). While images from freepik are free to use, attribution to the original source is a must; "Freepik License Free for personal and commercial purpose with attribution".

The LinkedIn page of GFG shares and replies with memes; not only are none of these memes credited, but GFG also goes to an extent of watermarking the images with their logo.

## Conclusion

This post is not to target GFG for its misuse of content. 

Bottom line, unless explicitly mentioned by the original author that it's free for commercial or personal use. Reach out to the owner for its fair usage, do your research before copying or reusing content (text, image, audio, and videos). Copyright laws differ from region to region; Use content from the public domain if you have to, the primary source of content for thousands of brands.
