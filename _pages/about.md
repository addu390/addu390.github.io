    <p>Balancing code <img class="twemoji" style="vertical-align: sub;" src="../assets/img/emoji/laptop.svg" />, creativity <img class="twemoji" style="vertical-align: sub;" src="../assets/img/emoji/palette.svg" />, and cardio <img class="twemoji" src="../assets/img/emoji/cart-wheel.svg" /> â€“ that's my life as a software engineer, artist, and fitness buff; </p>

<p>Since the end of 2023, I've been exploring the integration of videos and blogs. If you're like me and prefer reading documentations over watching videos but still appreciate visual aids, you're in the right place! <a class="underline" href="/">Pyblog</a> posts are rich with images and detailed explanations to help bridge the gap between text and visuals.</p>
