<p>"Pause & Shop" on Prime Video combines the thrill of shopping with the joy of entertainment, redefining the boundaries of engagement.</p>

<p>Traditional streaming services often leave viewers with a fragmented experience. While engrossed in their favorite movies or shows, viewers frequently encounter products, costumes, or props that pique their interest, yet they lack an efficient means to explore or purchase these items. This disconnect results in missed opportunities for both consumers and brands alike, leaving audiences longing for a more integrated and streamlined approach to entertainment and commerce.</p>

  <p>"Last weekend, my friends and I were watching a movie on Prime Video, and there was this stunning dress one of the characters wore that I absolutely fell in love with. Instead of scrambling to find it online later, I simply paused the movie and used the 'Pause & Shop' feature. Within minutes, I found the exact dress on Amazon and had it added to my cart. It was such a seamless experience! Prime Video not only entertained us but also made it incredibly easy to turn on-screen inspiration into real-life purchases. Can't wait to see what else I'll discover with this feature!"</p>
