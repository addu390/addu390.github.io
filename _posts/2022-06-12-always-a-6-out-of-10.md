Hey ðŸ‘‹ it's a work in progress, stay tuned! [Subscribe](https://pyblog.medium.com/subscribe) maybe?

Echoing the post from [Angela Zhou](https://www.angelazhou.info/post/not-good-enough-as-a-software-engineer-me-too) and positioning my perspective, here it goes:

Before I dive into any more details - to start with some background, I'm a computer science graduate student and open-source contributor at Google Summer of Code 2022. Before that, I worked as a Backend Engineer at [Clear](https://www.clear.in/) and [PhonePe](https://www.phonepe.com/), contributing to applications that serve over [370+ million users](https://www.phonepe.com/pulse/); it's fair to say that I have dealt with a lot of complex, intriguing problems at scale and almost always managed to get the best peer feedback on performance--despite coming from an electronics background, not too long ago, there was a time when all I did was circuit design and mostly worked with embedded C; I even have a diploma in AutoCAD in 2D and 3D design. Did I mention that I launched the brand Myro, a non-profit for manufacturing myoelectric prosthetics ðŸ¦¾

Although that sounds like a flex, it's the exact opposite. Seriously! as compared to the engineers out there who are launching rockets, building autonomous machines, developing open-source softwares used by millions, and so much more, I'm not even close to considering myself a good software engineer.
