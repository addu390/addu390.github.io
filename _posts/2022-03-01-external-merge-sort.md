<p style="text-align: center;">External Sorting â€” Totoro.</p>

External sorting is a class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data. External sorting is required when the data being sorted does not fit into the main memory of a computing device (RAM). Instead, they must reside in the slower external memory (Disk).

To explain the working of External Merge Sort using a Priority Queue, consider the input array: `[5, 8, 6, 3, 7, 1, 4, 9, 10, 2]`

Overview:
In the Split Phase, the large input file is split into smaller chunks that can be fit into the memory.
In the Merge Phase, perform K-way merge with each smaller chunk file one after the other and write the output to a file.

## Split Phase:

- Split the input into chunks (5 chunks).
- Then, sort each of the individual chunks.
- Finally, store the sorted chunks in files (5 temporary files).

Doing so, we have 5 files with:

Chunk 1: `[5, 8]`
Chunk 2: `[3, 6]`
Chunk 3: `[1, 7]`
Chunk 4: `[4, 9]`
Chunk 5: `[2, 10]`

## Merge Phase:

Create m number of `HeapNode`(s), where the value of the `HeapNode` is the chunkâ€™s lowest element, and store the reference to the temporary chunk file. 

Example:

```
{
	"element": 5,
	"file": <chunk-file>
} 
```

- Now, store all the m `HeapNode`(s) in a Min Heap, where the top node is always the minimum element in the heap:

```
                         1                       
                       /  \
                      2    5
                    /  \                         
                   4    3     
```

- Perform the heapify operation -> store the element in an output file -> replace the min element with the next element in the chuck file, which owns min element
- Pick the min element in the min-heap 1 and write it to an output file `1`
- Find the next element in the chunk file, which owns min element 1
- Number 7 from Chunk 3; move it to the heap and perform heapify

```
      7                                    2
    /  \                                 /  \
   2     5      Heapify -->             3    5	
  /  \                                 / \
 4    3                               4   7 
```

- Pick the min element 2 and append it to output file `1, 2`
- Find the next element in the chunk file, which owns min element 2
- Number 10 from Chunk 5; move it to the heap and perform heapify

```
      10                                   3
    /  \                                 /  \
   3     5      Heapify -->             4    5	
  /  \                                 / \
 4    7                               10   7 
```

- Pick the min element 3 and append it to output file `1, 2, 3`
- Find the next element in the chunk file, which owns min element 3
- Number 6 from Chunk 2; move it to the heap and perform heapify

```
      6                                   4
    /  \                                 /  \
   4     5      Heapify -->             6    5	
  /  \                                 / \
10   7                               10   7 
```

- Pick the min element 4 and append it to output file `1, 2, 3, 4`
- Find the next element in the chunk file, which owns min element 4
- Number 9 from Chunk 4; move it to the heap and perform heapify

```
      9                                   5
    /  \                                 /  \
   6     5      Heapify -->             6    9	
  /  \                                 / \
10   7                               10   7 
```

- Pick the min element 5 and append it to output file `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
- Find the next element in the chunk file, which owns min element 5
- Number 8 from Chunk 1; move it to the heap and perform heapify

```
      8                                   6
    /  \                                 /  \
   6     9      Heapify -->             7    9	
  /  \                                 / \
10   7                               10   8 
```

- If the next element in the chunk file is smaller than the current min element, replace the min element in `MAX_INTEGER` and repeat the process until all the elements in the heap are `MAX_INTEGER`
- Pick the min element 6 and append it to output file `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`
- Find the next element in the chunk file, which owns min element 6
- When you see EOF (End of Line), replace it with `MAX_INTEGER`

```
   MAX_INT                                 7
    /  \                                 /  \
   7    9      Heapify -->              8     9	
  /  \                                 / \
10   8                               10   MAX_INT
```

- Continue until the heap looks like:

```
                       MAX_INT                       
                        /   \
                    MAX_INT  MAX_INT
                    /    \                         
                 MAX_INT MAX_INT        
```

The final output: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10` ðŸ˜Ž
