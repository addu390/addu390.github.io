## Importance of OSS
Most of the applications, softwares, and tools we use day-to-day are built by thousands and millions of people all over the globe. So to the extent that **Free and Open Source Softwares** define who we are as `<insert a job role>` today. Be it a full-fledged product or technologies used to build one - languages, frameworks, databases, queues/buses, caching mechanisms, deployment tools, visualization dashboards, the list goes on; revolves around the OSS community.

Doesn't it already sound imperative to keep this community active and ever-growing?

Broadly, one can **contribute in two ways** (ideally both):
- **Sponsor** FOSS project(s), developer(s), organization(s); i.e., pay a reasonable amount that you can afford. It can be as low as $5 to start with. If you find your favorite project, consider being a monthly sponsorer.

- **Do what you do best**. Build features, fix bugs, revamp the design, improve the documentation, test the tool/application, find bugs and vulnerabilities.
