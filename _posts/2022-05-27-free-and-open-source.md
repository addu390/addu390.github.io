<p style="text-align: center;">A sincere thank you :) </p>

This isn't a post but rather a reminder. **Free and Open Source Softwares** define who we are as `<insert a job role>` (`developers`/`architects`/`designers`...) today. Be it languages, frameworks, databases, queues/buses, caching mechanisms, deployment tools, visualization dashboards, the list goes on; in other words, a lot of technologies we constantly use in our day-to-day lives are open source and built ground-up - thanks to the dedicated FOSS community.

Doesn't it already sound imperative to keep this community active and ever-growing?

Broadly, one can **contribute in two ways** (ideally both):
- **Sponsor** FOSS project(s), developer(s), organization(s); i.e., pay a reasonable amount that you can afford. It can be as low as $5 to start with. If you find your favorite project, consider being a monthly sponsorer.

- **Do what you do best**. Build features and fix bugs, revamp the design, improve the documentation, test the tool/application or find bugs and vulnerabilities.

**Advantages**, to list a few:
- Giving back to the community - also boosts the engineer morale.
- Find and meet top talent, no better way than contributing together to a project.
- Open source projects are inclusive; it doesn't matter who or where you are from.
- You tend to write significantly better code.
- Projects evolve faster and get more stable.

If you are an open-source developer, just know that you are highly appreciated :)
